#Actually, including one of each to test against CG on adding new methods is a good idea, and should be incorporated
#All 3 kinds of datasets also need a case with only a few non-ds points

#Precipitation pre-processing is an entirely different issue, and should be treated as such

##All right, FINE. The number of unmasked spatial cases shouldn't have an effect on the
