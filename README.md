       Framework for Unified Downscaling of GCMs Empirically (FUDGE)

This file is part of the NOAA-GFDL FUDGE project (Framework for Unified Downscaling of GCMs Empirically), referred to as NOAA-GFDL/FUDGE. The majority of this code was written by authors at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), who are providing the code with the disclaimer shown below.

  What is it?
  -----------

  FUDGE is a tool for exploring the possible space of statistical downscaling methods by 
  running experiments that vary over downscaling method, downscaling method parameters, 
  data used in the downscaling process, and pre- and post-downscaling adjustment
  of the data. 

  The Latest Version
  ------------------

  The latest verified version is the darkchocolate release. For more
  information, please consult the release notes.

  Documentation
  -------------

  The documentation included with this release is located in 
  the documentation/ directory. 

  Requirements
  ------------
  This code has been running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.6 (Santiago)

  This code requires access to:
  - R 2.15 or higher (has been tested in 3.0, but not with the entire workflow)
  -- R packages ncdf4, ncdf4.helpers, CDFt, PCICt, udunits2
  - nco 4.0.3 or higher
  - netcdf 4.0.1 or higher
  - nccmp 1.1 or higher
  - python 2.7.1
  -- python packages pprint,datetime,getopt, os, shutil, shlex, 
     sys, subprocess, optparse, argparse
  - GFDL in-house transfer tools in HPC (gcp 2.3 or higher)
  - moab 7 or higher
  - access to a c-shell for scripting

  Licensing
  ---------

  Please see the file called license.md

  Warnings
  -----------------------------

  1. This code has been designed for work with the GDFL machines. We make no guarantee that it 
  will still work properly outside of the GFDL. 

  2. This code is a work in progress. The darkchocolate workflow has passed its current tests, 
  but is still undergoing revision. 

  3. In the course of development, we found that the internal data structures were changing too
  fast for unit regression tests to be useful, and switched to regression tests upon the downscaled
  output. However, those regression tests rely on the GFDL filesystem for input data, and the incusion
  of the end-products of downscaling files to check against would have dramatically increased the size 
  of the repository. There is an explanation of the current regression testing procedure in the file 
  Regression_tests/README_regression_tests.md
